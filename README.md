# GunControl
## Custom *nix launcher for GunBot

---

**v0.0.1** â€¢ May 2017.


GunControl will help you run all trading pairs simultaneously. Script will search GunBot folder for correct .js config files and will try to run'em all as background processes with `screen`. 

Also you can use built-in script commands as well. Script can start / stop all or shows a list of currently running pairs. 

**Usage**: `bash guncontrol.sh [ start [pair] [exchange], stop [pair], list ]`
