# GunControl
## Custom *nix launcher for GunBot

---

**v0.0.1** â€¢ May 2017.


GunControl will help you run all trading pairs simultaneously. Script will search GunBot folder for correct .js config files and will try to run'em all as background processes with `screen`. 

Put `guncontrol.sh` in the GunBot folder and run it with bash. You can use built-in script commands to start/stop trading for all pairs or just show a list of currently running pairs. 

**Usage**: `bash guncontrol.sh [ start [pair] [exchange], stop [pair], list ]`
